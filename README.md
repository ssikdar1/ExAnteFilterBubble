# ExAnteFilterBubble

Github repository for `The Ex-Ante View of Recommender System Design`

paper can be found [here link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10527)

Simulation code can be found in `simulations.py`. 
R code to generate graphs can be found at `create_graphs.R`.

Notes: 
⋅⋅* we've used `joblib` for parallelization so you may need to modify `num_cores` to run optimally on your system.
⋅⋅* JIT compiler `numba` used to speed up `numpy` computations
